# Customized ANNs for CPUE Standardization

This repository contains the implementation of Customized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort) standardization in fisheries management. The customized ANNs are tailored to address challenges related to overfitting and lack of interpretability, offering improved accuracy and insights into fish abundance trends and distribution patterns.

*ANN models with different structures. (a) ANN\_F model that treats all variables as inputs to an MLP. (b) ANN\_S model that only considers the longitude and latitude interactions, and then combines the output of an MLP with other variables. (c) ANN\_ST model that considers the space-time interactions. (d) An example of a customized ANN that includes multiple non-linear terms.*




## Features
1. Customized ANNs tailored to specific fisheries and ecological systems
2. Incorporation of spatial-temporal modules for dynamic fish distribution patterns
3. Improved interpretability for a better understanding of underlying relationships
4. Resilience to overfitting, enhancing model generalization capabilities
