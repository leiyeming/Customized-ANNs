# Customized ANNs for CPUE Standardization

This repository contains the implementation of Customized Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort) standardization in fisheries management. The customized ANNs are tailored to address challenges related to overfitting and lack of interpretability, offering improved accuracy and insights into fish abundance trends and distribution patterns.


Features
1. First item
Customized ANNs tailored to specific fisheries and ecological systems
Improved interpretability for better understanding of underlying relationships
Resilience to overfitting, enhancing model generalization capabilities
Incorporation of spatial-temporal modules for dynamic fish distribution patterns
